The goal is to implement a simple interface allowing you to search in a list of recipes.
This search can be done both from a main search bar and from advances search fields.
The search algorithms have been particularly studied to be the most efficient possible in the restitution
recipes in the DOM based on the filters applied. 
You also have two different branches. On the first (feature / OP7-functional-algorithm) you will find these algorithms implemented only with the functional methods
(forEach, map, and filter). On the second (feature / OP7-oriented-object-algorithm), the for loop methods are used.
The page is responsive and has been validated by the W3C validator.

Start-up:
You just need to clone the project and run an npm install or yarn install. The data is hard-loaded into the
directory api / data.
You can then open the index.html on your preferred browser.

Webstorm - Text editor
